Things I was not able to do:
6/7.)       I wasnt sure if you needed a comma delimiter between the address so I did not include it.
10.)        I couldn't figure out what was considered punctuation marks in the english dictionary
            so instead I made sure it had \W Predefined character class. \W was the non-word character
            so I used that as punctuations.
