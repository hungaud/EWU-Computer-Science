Since exec changes the process image does your program leak memory?
mine did not

What happens when an invalid command is passed to the pipe either as prePipe or postPipe?
an error message will show what command was invalid starting with prePipe. if prePipe is invalid then the itll notify the user and prompt a new command without checking postpipe. If postpipe is invalid it'll notify the user and prompt a new command.

If prePipe or postPipe are invalid is memory leaked?
yes memory does leak, but the overall program doesnt leak memory
